    Summary of Approach:
    I use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that 
    ends at index i. For each index i, I compare nums[i] with all elements at earlier indices j < i in the array. 
    If nums[j] < nums[i], I update dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1). The final answer is the maximum value in dp.

    A:

        if cur < next:
            # we add it to subsequence
            dp[cur_idx] = 1+ dp[next_idx]

        
        [9,1,4,2,3,3,7]
        [1,4,2,3,2,2,1]
