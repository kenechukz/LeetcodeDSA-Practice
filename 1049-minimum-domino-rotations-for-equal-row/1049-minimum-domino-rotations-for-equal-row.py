        Optimal:
        The only possible final numbers are:
        tops[0] or bottoms[0]
        Because any valid target must appear in at least one of every domino.
        So â€” just test both.

        e.g. for example 1 bottoms[0] isn't valid (once we get to 2nd iter i=1) on first if condition, 
        so we assign it infinity
        however for top[0], it is equal to tops[i] or bottoms[i] at each index
        so we return min of the rotations needed for the bottom and the rotations needed for the top
